<h2>🧩 Problem Statement & System Goals</h2>

<p>
Construction sites are high-risk environments where safety compliance is critical to prevent injuries, fatalities, and legal violations. Despite regulations mandating the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) like hardhats, safety vests, and masks, enforcement remains inconsistent due to manual monitoring, human error, and lack of scalable tools.
</p>

<h3>Pain Points</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Manual safety checks are time-consuming and error-prone</li>
  <li>Non-compliance often goes unnoticed until incidents occur</li>
  <li>Site managers lack real-time visibility into PPE violations</li>
  <li>Workers may unintentionally skip gear due to oversight or discomfort</li>
</ul>

<h3>System Goals</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Automate detection of PPE compliance using computer vision</li>
  <li>Provide instant feedback on missing or incorrect gear</li>
  <li>Enable non-technical users to assess safety from simple image uploads</li>
  <li>Support scalable, remote monitoring across multiple sites</li>
  <li>Align with safety standards by clearly categorizing compliant vs. non-compliant detections</li>
</ul>

<p>
This system empowers construction teams to proactively identify risks, enforce safety protocols, and reduce the likelihood of accidents — all through a simple, accessible web interface.
